## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Fun With Flags** (“we”, “our”, or “us”).  
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it.  
This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our mobile application **Fun With Flags** (the “App”).  

The App is designed for educational and entertainment purposes and can be used by individuals of all ages, including children under 13.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect
We do **not** collect, store, or share any personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any form of user-generated content.  

The App does **not** require login, signup, or any personal data entry.

## 3. Automatically Collected Information
While we do not collect data directly, third-party services integrated in the App (like **Google AdMob**) may automatically collect limited technical information such as:
- Device type, model, and operating system version  
- Non-personal usage statistics (for analytics and performance)  
- Approximate location (non-identifiable)  
- Advertising identifiers (for displaying ads)

This information is handled solely by Google under their privacy terms:

## 4. Advertising and Children’s Privacy
Our App displays ads provided by **Google AdMob** and its partners.  
Because the App may be used by children, we have enabled AdMob’s **child-directed treatment** flag to ensure ads are appropriate for all audiences.  

This means:
- Ads are **contextual only** (based on app content, not user behavior)  
- No personalized ads or user tracking are performed  
- AdMob complies with **COPPA** and **Google Play Families Policy**

## 5. Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or trade any personal information.  
Any data used for advertising or analytics is managed directly by Google or its verified partners under their own privacy policies.

---

## 6. Data Retention
Since we do not collect personal data, we do not retain any user information.  
Any aggregated or anonymized data collected by third-party services is stored only as long as necessary for legitimate operational purposes, according to their policies.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy and Parental Consent
We take children’s privacy seriously.  
The App complies with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** and the **Google Play Families Policy**.
